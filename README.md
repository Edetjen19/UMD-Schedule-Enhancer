This is a Chrome extension that enhances the UMD Schedule of Classes website. It adds a few features that make it easier to use such as the the average GPA and the professor ratings from [PlanetTerp](https://planetterp.com/) and [RateMyProfessors](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/). It also allows users to sort the classes by the average GPA, making it easy to find the least difficult classes. View the example page before the additions [here](https://app.testudo.umd.edu/soc/search?courseId=CMSC&sectionId=&termId=202401&_openSectionsOnly=on&creditCompare=%3E%3D&credits=0.0&courseLevelFilter=ALL&instructor=&_facetoface=on&_blended=on&_online=on&courseStartCompare=&courseStartHour=&courseStartMin=&courseStartAM=&courseEndHour=&courseEndMin=&courseEndAM=&teachingCenter=ALL&_classDay1=on&_classDay2=on&_classDay3=on&_classDay4=on&_classDay5=on).


# Unfortunately Rate My Professor changed their site layout so the scraper is currently broken

This will be fixed soon, though in the meantime if you would like to see what the extension does, check out this goofy tikok I made for marketing!
